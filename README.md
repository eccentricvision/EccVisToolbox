# EccVisToolbox
Eccentric Vision Toolbox
Code written for the Eccentric Vision Lab at University College London
http://eccentricvision.com

Mostly by John Greenwood (except as noted)

Feel free to use the code, but please credit the toolbox, as per the GNU License. Comments and readme files are somewhat incomplete at present, but I'm working to update these at present. There may be some functions in here written by others, which I'm working to separate out in time. 

Includes the folders:
------------------------------------------

-Calibration (monitor luminance/gamma calibration and various spatial calibration routines)

-CurveFitting (various curves that can be fit to data, including cumulative Gaussian functions)

-DakinFunctions (code written by Steven Dakin, included with permission)

-GeneralExptCode (functions used in running experiments via Psychtoolbox, mostly to set up screens etc)

-GeneralFunctions (various useful functions, mostly for running experiments or performing conversions)

-StimulusElements (code to generate images for presentation, e.g. via Psychtoolbox, including Landolt-Cs, Gabors, etc)
