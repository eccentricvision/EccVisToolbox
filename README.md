-Calibration (monitor luminance/gamma calibration and various spatial calibration routines)

-CurveFitting (various curves that can be fit to data, including cumulative Gaussian functions)

-DakinFunctions (code written by Steven Dakin, included with permission)

-GeneralExptCode (functions used in running experiments via Psychtoolbox, mostly to set up screens etc)
